# AI Fact-Checking Agent Analysis

## 1. Scenario with False/Scam-Related Information

Our AI fact-checking agent is particularly relevant given recent real-world incidents where AI-generated false legal information has been submitted in actual court cases. Here are notable examples:

### Mata v. Avianca Case (2023)

In this unprecedented case in New York federal court, lawyers submitted a brief containing six fictitious legal cases generated by ChatGPT. The consequences were severe:

* Judge P. Kevin Castel imposed $5,000 fines on the lawyers and their firm
* The lawyers claimed they were unaware ChatGPT could produce false information
* The case became a landmark warning about AI-generated legal misinformation

### British Columbia Case (2023)

A similar incident occurred in Canada where:

* A lawyer submitted legal briefs containing non-existent cases generated by ChatGPT
* The judge found no intent to deceive but ordered the lawyer to pay court costs
* The case highlighted cross-jurisdictional concerns about AI in legal practice

### Michael Cohen Incident (2023)

Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's case further illustrates these risks:

* Cohen unknowingly used AI-generated fake legal citations from Google Bard
* The false citations were submitted to a judge
* Unlike Mata v. Avianca, no sanctions were imposed due to the unintentional nature

These real-world examples demonstrate why fact-checking AI-generated legal information is crucial. Our agent helps prevent such incidents by:

* Verifying claims against real search results
* Cross-referencing multiple sources
* Providing clear accuracy ratings
* Highlighting potential misinformation

## 3. Classification Method/Pipeline

Our AI fact-checking agent uses the following pipeline to classify legal information:

1. **Information Collection**

   * Takes user's statement as input
   * Automatically generates a "fact check" search query
   * Uses Brave Search API to retrieve relevant web results
   * Collects top search results with titles, summaries, and sources

2. **AI Analysis**

   * Processes search results through Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct or Mistral-7B-Instruct(Default) model
   * Compares statement against search results
   * Looks for credible sources and recent information
   * Identifies contradictions and supporting evidence

3. **Classification and Explanation**

   * Rates statements on a 5-point scale:
     * TRUE: Completely accurate
     * MOSTLY TRUE: Generally accurate with minor inaccuracies
     * MIXED: Contains both true and false elements
     * MOSTLY FALSE: Contains significant inaccuracies
     * FALSE: Completely inaccurate
   * Provides detailed explanation with evidence
   * Highlights important context and nuances

## 4. Advantages of the Method

1. **Real-Time Verification**

   * Uses current web data through Brave Search API
   * Can fact-check recent statements and claims
   * Adapts to newly available information
   * Provides up-to-date context and sources

2. **Multi-Source Analysis**

   * Examines multiple search results simultaneously
   * Cross-references different sources
   * Reduces dependency on single source
   * Identifies consensus or contradictions

3. **Structured Rating System**

   * Uses clear, defined accuracy levels
   * Provides nuanced assessment beyond true/false
   * Includes evidence-based explanations
   * Maintains consistent evaluation criteria

## 5. Disadvantages and Limitations

1. **Search API Limitations**

   * Dependent on Brave Search API coverage
   * Limited to top few search results
   * May miss relevant information not in search results
   * Requires active internet connection

2. **Model Constraints**

   * Limited by LLM's training data cutoff
   * May struggle with highly technical or specialized topics
   * Could be affected by model biases
   * Potential for hallucination in analysis

3. **Source Verification Challenges**

   * Cannot independently verify source authenticity
   * Relies on search engine ranking
   * May encounter outdated information
   * Difficulty with paywalled or restricted content

This analysis demonstrates how our AI fact-checking agent approaches the challenge of distinguishing between genuine and fabricated legal information, while acknowledging both its strengths and limitations in this critical task.
